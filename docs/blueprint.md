## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to give a futuristic and premium feel. Inspired by violet color, the color with the highest payout.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212121) to create a modern, sophisticated backdrop and let the bright colours pop. Same hue as primary, but highly desaturated.
- Accent color: Vibrant magenta (#E91E63) for interactive elements, such as buttons and bet selections. This analogous color gives nice contrast to the primary purple.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' for a futuristic, clean, tech-inspired look.

- Implement a full-screen layout with clearly defined sections for betting options, wallet balance, and results, making navigation intuitive and straightforward.
- Incorporate subtle animations when displaying results and updating wallet balances to enhance user engagement and provide a polished feel.
